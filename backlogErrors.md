- review buisines model and interface
- review monthlybusinessreport model and interface

- create a monthly report that updates daily after daily sales report is calculate (not dynamic)
this will be the metrics from the whole business
it supose to close every last day of the month
same logic as inventory

- for the future, everything name with "table" supose to be rename because we dont create tables, we creata "salesLocation" - ex ITable / model table / createTable

- update all POST and PATCH with the siyntax of PURCHASE routes, it is more efficienty, less DB calls

- find out all notifications scenario and update notification routes

- would be good to rename every property in dailySalesReport model to be on same page as monthlyBusinessReport

- create a monthly business report (rent, mortgage, utility bill, employee costs, purchases, other costs, sales - calculation as minimun to break even)

Daily Sales Target:
You can define a minimum daily sales target that covers your expenses (break-even point) and then aim for higher targets based on historical data.
daily sales target = sun of all costs of metrics / number of days in the month

Gross Profit Margin:
COGS = cost of goods sold
Since you are tracking costs, it’s important to track how much revenue is left after covering food, beverage, and labor costs. This will help measure overall profitability.
Gross Profit Margin = ((Total Sales − COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)) / Total Sales) * 100
 
Net Profit Margin:
This is the percentage of revenue remaining after all expenses (including fixed costs) are deducted. This shows the restaurant’s true profitability.
Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Total Sales) * 100

Minimum Daily Sales (Break-even Sales):
The minimum sales required to cover all costs (fixed and variable). Calculated as:
Break-even Sales = Fixed Costs / (1 − (Variable Costs/Sales)) 
Track this daily to ensure sales cover basic expenses like rent, salaries, utilities, and food costs.

Food Cost Percentage:
A key profitability metric to monitor the cost of ingredients relative to sales. Typically, food costs should range between 28%-35%.
Food Cost Percentage = (Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Total Sales)  * 100

Labor Cost Percentage:
Track the labor cost as a percentage of revenue. Keep it around 20%-30% depending on the type of restaurant.
Labor Cost Percentage = (Labor Costs / Total Sales) * 100

Gross Profit Margin:
The percentage of sales revenue that turns into gross profit, after deducting the cost of food and labor.
Gross Profit Margin = ((Sales - (COGS + Labor Costs)) / Sales) * 100

Net Profit Margin:
Measures overall profitability after all expenses.
Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Total Sales) * 100

*** operational metrics / daily operation
Maximum Acceptable Waste (Food Waste Ratio):
Set a limit on how much food waste is acceptable. Reducing waste saves money.
Food Waste Percentage = (Value of Wasted Food / Total Food Purchased) * 100
Aiming for less than 5% food waste is typical.

Inventory Turnover:
Measure how fast inventory is used. A low turnover may indicate overstocking or poor sales.
Inventory Turnover = (COGS / Average Inventory)

Table Turnover Rate:
Measures how many times a table is used during a specific period. A higher turnover rate increases potential sales.
Table Turnover Rate = (Total Number of Guests Served / Number of Tables) * Period (Hours)

Sales per Labor Hour:
Measures labor efficiency by tracking how much revenue is generated for each hour of labor.
Sales per Labor Hour = (Total Sales / Total Labor Hours)

Sales of promotions
Sales of promotions = (total sales / promotion sales) * 10

Food Waste Target: ≤ 5%
    separate the targets by type of food
Labor Cost Target: 20-30% of sales
Food Cost Target: 28-35% of sales

Waste by Category (Food, Beverage):
Beyond the total supplier waste, you should also track food and beverage waste separately to see which category is causing the most loss.
Food Waste Percentage = (Total Food Waste Value / Total Food Purchases) * 100
